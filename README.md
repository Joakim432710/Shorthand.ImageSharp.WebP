# Shorthand.ImageSharp.WebP [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/karl-sjogren/Shorthand.ImageSharp.WebP/_apis/build/status/karl-sjogren.Shorthand.ImageSharp.WebP?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/karl-sjogren/Shorthand.ImageSharp.WebP/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

Adds a WebP format for ImageSharp. Only for encoding images so far.

This will be more or less obsolete after real WebP supports lands in ImageSharp through https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/1271.

This uses the binaries from https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html since setting up build environments to build dll/so files for all platforms was waay to much work. Getting that up and running is something for the future.
